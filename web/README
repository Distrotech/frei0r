Org-mode generated website setup for dyne.org

This directory contains .org files for content
and scripts to render the website locally for preview
once pushed on the server the website will be visible

To activate local preview make sure you have installed Emacs
and TexLive on your distribution, then manually install the
latest stable version of Org-mode from orgmode.org

from inside orgmode, do:

 make
 sudo make install
 sudo cp -ra contrib/lisp/* /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

this will install the latest version in /usr/local/share

then run make in this directory to generate the site
and then follow instructions to activate the apache.conf

happy hacking ;^)
