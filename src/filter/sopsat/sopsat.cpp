/**
  This filter implements a standard way of color correction proposed by
  the American Society of Cinematographers: The Color Decision List, also
  known as the

     ASC CDL

  More information about the ASC CDL can be found on Wikipedia[1], and
  the current revision of the specification, including example code, can
  be obtained by sending a mail to asc-cdl at theasc dot com. (Really works.)

  The ASC CDL is a standard format for basic primary color correction (primary
  meaning affecting the whole image and not only selected parts). Even big
  editing systems use it :) This filter only obtains the values; Importing and
  exporting to one of the possible ASC CDL exchange files must be done elsewhere.

  Basically there are two stages in the correction:
  1. SOP correction for each channel separately
  2. Overall saturation correction
  All corrections work on [0,1], so the RGB(A) values need to be transposed
  from {0,...,255} to [0,1].
  1. SOP correction
     * Slope:   out = in * slope;   0 <= slope < \infty
     * Offset:  out = in + offset;  -\infty < offset < \infty
     * Power:   out = in^power;     0 < power < \infty
  2. Saturation
     * Luma:    Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B (according to Rec. 709)
     * Forall channels:
                out = luma + sat * (in-luma)
  As the values may exceed 1 (or 0), they need to be clamped where necessary.
